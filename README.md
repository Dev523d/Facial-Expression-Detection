Note: this model use pre trained machine learning Model
##Required Python version 3 or greater 

>Required Libraries

```
pip install numpy
pip install opencv
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install tkinter
```

## Restrictions for this model:

1)At one time only one person should be allowed to check its mood because this system works on one face at a time.it can create problem if more than one face is being captured.

2)The person should be in good lightning condition so that its face should be visible.
